the hauntedhouse.json map implements some extra features of allowing the user to heal (command "heal") using bandages found in one of the rooms. 
The players health is reduced after attacks depending on the aggressiveness of the enemy, some attacks kill instantly whereas some take away large
amounts of health points. The player can see their health by using the "health" command. 
Also, once used these bandages are removed from the users inventory. The item perishes after one use.
