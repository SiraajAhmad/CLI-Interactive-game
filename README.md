# CLI-Interactive-game
Originally developed as part of my university coursework, this application allows the user to play a CLI interface text game. The user loads in different maps and uses commands to achieve the objectives. 

Instructions:
CD to the Directory in a linux terminal and run command "make"
Then run command "./main XXX" with the hauntedhouse map file name replacing XXX. Eg: "./main hauntedhouse.json"

This will load the map and the game will commence.
